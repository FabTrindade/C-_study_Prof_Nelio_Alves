# Files exercise. 

#### Note: No string.Split resource usage.

#### This exercise aims to exemplify file handling using the following problem:
Make a program to read the path of a .csv file containing the data of items sold. Each item has a name, unit price and quantity, separated by a comma. You must generate a new file called "summary.csv", located in a subfolder called "out" from the original folder of the source file, containing only the name and total value for that item (unit price multiplied by quantity), as an example.
