# Interface exercise. 



#### This exercise aims to exemplify the usege of interface resource:


A company wants to automate the processing of its contracts. Processing a contract consists of generating the installments to be paid for that contract, based on the desired number of months.
The company uses an online payment service to pay the installments. Online payment services typically charge a monthly interest as well as a fee per payment. For now, the service contracted by the company is Paypal, which applies a simple interest of 1% to each installment, plus a payment fee of 2%.
Make a program to read data from a contract (contract number, contract date, and contract total value). Then, the program must read the number of months for the contract to be paid in installments, and then generate the records of installments to be paid (date and amount), with the first installment to be paid one month after the contract date, the second installment two months after the contract and so on. Show plot data on screen.
